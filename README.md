# Lines-of-Pandas

This Jupyter Notebook computes the number of lines of pandas written within a given time range (6 months in my case). 
- A "line" is considered a sequence of code separated by a \n. 

- A "line of pandas" is considered a line like above BUT the script needs to find at least on instance of "import pandas" within the code otherwise non of the lines count.
